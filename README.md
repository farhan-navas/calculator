Basic calculator webpage programmed according to requirements on TheOdinProject. Most of the functionalities have been covered except for a few additional ones that I have yet to add. These remaining functions are;
1) A backspace button that will clear the currNumber var and adjust currDisplayNumber automatically
2) THE HARDER PART: Add keyboard support. One problem that I might encounter is for multiplication whether use x or * so that one have to take note

(Figue out how to do this as well)
